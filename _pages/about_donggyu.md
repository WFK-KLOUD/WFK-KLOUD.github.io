Hello, I'm a junior majoring in Materials Science and Engineering. I love spending my free time having fun and enjoying various activities. Originally, I aimed to major in piano, but I had to give up that dream due to my small hands. This led me to pursue a path in engineering instead.

I still don't know exactly what I want to do in the future, but I enjoy learning languages and am currently mastering Japanese as a second foreign language. Although I'm not particularly strong in chemistry or physics, I have some interest in these subjects and plan to work in the field of semiconductors or electronic materials.
