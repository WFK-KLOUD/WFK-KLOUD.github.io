I am a junior in GIST and majoring Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I am interested in AI and Computer Vision.

I am a big fan of the Korean baseball team NC Dinos, but I am sad that they are not doing well this year. Also, I love playing soccer and playing the clarinet in the orchestra.
